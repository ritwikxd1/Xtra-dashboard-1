## 🚀 Setup

**1. Install dependencies**
```
npm install
```

**2. Create a `.env` file**
```env
TOKEN=your_bot_token
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_oauth_secret
DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
SESSION_SECRET=any_random_string
DASHBOARD_PORT=3000
```

**3. Deploy slash commands**
```
npm run deploy
```
> Global commands propagate to all servers within ~1 hour.

**4. Start the bot**
```
npm start
```

**5. Open the dashboard** → `http://localhost:1121`

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Multi-guild** — all data fully isolated per `guild_id` in a single SQLite database
- **Global commands** — one deploy covers every server the bot is in
- **Data persistence** — guild settings are kept even if the bot leaves a server
- **Dual command system** — every command works as both `/slash` and `b!prefix`
- **Dashboard** — Express + Discord OAuth2, runs alongside the bot in the same process
- **Emoji sync** — custom emojis uploaded once and ID-cached to `data/emoji-cache.json`, surviving restarts
